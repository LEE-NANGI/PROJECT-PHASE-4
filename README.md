## Introduction

![film](readme_img.jpeg)

Recommendation systems are a critical component of modern business strategies, playing a pivotal role in providing personalized experiences to users. These systems leverage data analysis techniques to predict user preferences and suggest products, services, or information that align with these preferences. From online shopping giants like Amazon to streaming platforms like Netflix, recommendation systems are employed to enhance user engagement, increase sales, and improve customer retention. They represent a powerful tool for businesses to understand their customers better and provide a tailored user experience.

Recommendation systems operate on the principle of finding patterns in user behavior data, which can be explicit, such as ratings, or implicit, like click-through rates. They use various algorithms to predict and recommend items that a user might find interesting. 

## Problem Statement

Recommendation systems are applicable in many fields and are used in various ways to improve the business and maximize on profits. For instance they can be used for;
Personalization businesses need to understand their customers' preferences and behaviors in order to provide personalized recommendations. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Sales growth recommendation systems can help businesses increase their sales by suggesting relevant products or services to customers, encouraging additional purchases.
Improved user experience by recommending relevant content, businesses can enhance the user experience on their platforms, making navigation easier and more enjoyable for customers.
Data Analysis businesses can gain valuable insights from the data collected through recommendation systems, such as identifying popular products or trends.
Customer Retention by providing personalized and relevant recommendations, businesses can increase customer retention rates.
In this project; we are going to focus more on how it improves the user experience, through the implementation of a recommendation system that provides tailored product suggestions that align with individual preferences and interests. 

The project aim; 

* To build a model that provides top 5 movie recommendations to a user, based on their ratings of other movies. 

## Conclusion 

The quest to build an optimal recommendation model started with the KNNBasic, SVD, KNNBaseline,  all yielding an initial average RMSE of 0.89 Using gridsearchCV I explored KNNBasic, KNNBaseline, and SVD models, fine-tuning each through grid search for better performance.

After gridsearchCV, the KNNBaseline model has the lowest RMSE of 0.86 and MAE of 0.66 on test data, indicating that it has the highest accuracy among the three models. However, it took significantly longer to compute (300 minutes).

In terms of accuracy, the KNNBaseline model is the best choice. However, if computation time is a critical factor, then the SVD model might be a better choice as it has slightly higher error rates but likely much lower computation time.

Itâ€™s important to consider the trade-off between accuracy and computation time based on your specific needs and constraints. If you have the computational resources and time, then KNNBaseline would be recommended for its superior accuracy. However, if you need quicker results, then SVD would be a more efficient choice.

## Recommendation

If accuracy is your top priority and you can afford the computational time, KNNBaseline is the best-performing model among the three. Its lower RMSE and MAE suggest it can provide more accurate recommendations.

If computational efficiency is a concern and a slightly lower level of accuracy is acceptable, SVD is a good compromise. It offers reasonable accuracy without the extensive computational requirements of KNNBaseline.

Solve the cold start problem by employing strategies like content-based recommendations for new users or items.

Evaluate the model using a variety of metrics like precision, recall, MAP and NCGD.
